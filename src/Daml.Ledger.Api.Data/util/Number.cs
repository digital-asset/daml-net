    /**
     * The abstract class {@code Number} is the superclass of platform
     * classes representing numeric values that are convertible to the
     * primitive types {@code byte}, {@code double}, {@code float}, {@code
     * int}, {@code long}, and {@code short}.
     *
     * The specific semantics of the conversion from the numeric value of
     * a particular {@code Number} implementation to a given primitive
     * type is defined by the {@code Number} implementation in question.
     *
     * For platform classes, the conversion is often analogous to a
     * narrowing primitive conversion or a widening primitive conversion
     * as defining in <cite>The Java&trade; Language Specification</cite>
     * for converting between primitive types.  Therefore, conversions may
     * lose information about the overall magnitude of a numeric value, may
     * lose precision, and may even return a result of a different sign
     * than the input.
     *
     * See the documentation of a given {@code Number} implementation for
     * conversion details.
